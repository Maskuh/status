  Status Checker  
</h1>

Picture this, it's 4am and suddenly your server goes down. Users begin complaining and flooding your support channels. Nobody is online to help.

Status Checker aims to solve this problem. With just a few commands, you can have notifications for your server setup so that the instant your bot goes offline, your members are aware of it. Custom down messages publishing them for free.
# Self Hosting

I kindly ask that you don't, at least not for now, for the following reasons:
- You have to sort out and pay for a host.
- When it goes wrong (and it will) you'll flood our support channels asking for help, they are not for this and no help will be provided.
- Your bot won't stay up to date with latest vulnerabilities/changes in code.

# running the bot

If you do end up running the bot you have a number of options
- python3 run.py
- bash run.sh (macOS and Linux only)
- run.bat (Windows only)
- Docker container
