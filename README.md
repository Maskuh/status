  Status Checker  
</h1>

Picture this, it's 4am and suddenly your bot goes down. Users begin complaining and flooding your support channel. Nobody is online to help.

Status Checker aims to solve this problem. With just a few commands, you can have notifications for your bot setup so that the instant your bot goes offline, your members are aware of it. Custom down messages and automatically publishing them for free.

# Command List

`/add <channel> <bot> <custom down message> <auto publishing>` - add a bot to track.

`/remove` - remove a bot to track.

Yes, it's that simple. Add Status Checker today and let your members know of downtimes immediately.

# Self Hosting

I kindly ask that you don't for the following reasons:
- You have to sort out and pay for a host.
- When it goes wrong (and it will) you'll flood our support channels asking for help, they are not for this and no help will be provided.
- Your bot won't stay up to date with latest vulnerabilities/changes in code.
